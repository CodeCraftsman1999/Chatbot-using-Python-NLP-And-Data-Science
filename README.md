# Chatbot-using-Python-NLP-And-Data-Science
The repository "Chatbot-using-Python-NLP-And-Data-Science" is a project that demonstrates the creation of a chatbot using Python, Natural Language Processing (NLP), and Data Science techniques. The project includes the following components:

Data Collection: The project collects data from various sources, including social media platforms, customer reviews, and chat logs. The data is collected using web scraping techniques and APIs provided by the platforms.
Data Preprocessing: The collected data is preprocessed to remove noise, handle missing values, and convert the data into a format that can be used for analysis. The preprocessing steps include tokenization, stemming, stopword removal, and lemmatization.
Data Analysis: The preprocessed data is analyzed using various Data Science techniques, including statistical analysis, machine learning, and deep learning. The analysis is used to identify patterns, trends, and insights in the data.
Chatbot Development: A chatbot is developed using Python and NLP techniques. The chatbot is trained on the preprocessed data and is able to understand and respond to user queries. The chatbot is integrated with various platforms, including social media platforms, messaging apps, and websites.
Evaluation and Improvement: The chatbot is evaluated based on various metrics, including accuracy, response time, and user satisfaction. The chatbot is continuously improved based on the evaluation results and user feedback.
The project includes various Jupyter notebooks and Python scripts that demonstrate the various components of the project. The project also includes a detailed documentation that explains the various steps involved in the project. Overall, the project provides a comprehensive solution for building a chatbot using Python, NLP, and Data Science techniques.

Rule based bot code explanation-This Python code defines a simple conversational bot called RuleBot that engages in conversations with users. Here's an explanation of the code:

Import Statements: The code imports the necessary modules: random for generating random responses and re for regular expression matching.

Class Definition: The RuleBot class encapsulates the functionality of the bot.

Class Attributes:

negative_responses: Tuple containing potential negative responses from the user.
exit_commands: Tuple containing keywords for exiting the conversation.
random_questions: Tuple containing random starter questions for the bot.
Constructor (__init__): Initializes the alienbabble dictionary, which maps conversation intents to regular expression patterns. Each intent corresponds to a specific type of conversation the bot can engage in.

Instance Methods:

greet(): Greets the user and prompts them to engage in conversation.
make_exit(reply): Checks if the user wants to exit the conversation.
chat(): Initiates the conversation loop, where the bot prompts the user with a random question and responds accordingly.
match_reply(reply): Matches the user's reply with predefined conversation intents using regular expressions and generates an appropriate response.
describe_planet_intent(), answer_why_intent(), about_EternalTECHpandey(), no_match_intent(): Methods that return responses based on specific conversation intents.
Explanation:

The greet() method asks the user's name and whether they want to help the bot learn about their planet.
The chat() method initiates the conversation loop, where the bot asks random questions and responds to the user's input.
The match_reply() method matches the user's input with predefined conversation intents using regular expressions and selects an appropriate response.
The describe_planet_intent(), answer_why_intent(), and about_EternalTECHpandey() methods return random responses related to specific conversation topics.
The no_match_intent() method returns a random response when the user's input does not match any predefined intents.
Overall, this code provides a basic framework for a conversational bot with predefined conversation topics and responses.
